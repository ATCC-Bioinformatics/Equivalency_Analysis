quality_puller.py takes a list of genbank accessions and downloads assembly statistics to a shared table.
The equivalent data for ATCC assemblies can be captured from the SBC Dashboard under the assemblies table.

The Busco folder contains a few commands related to the installation and use of Busco to generate completion metrics for each genbank sequence (already exists for atcc sequences)
