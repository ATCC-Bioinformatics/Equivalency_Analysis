This repository contains the various scripts and input files used in ATCC's Equivalency Analysis (name to be updated with final publicaiton name).

There are three folders containing scripts related to the compilation and generation of various data.

1. Assembly_statistics contains scripts related to the creation of supplementary tables S3 and S4 where tableS3 represents assembly statistic to assembly statistic comparisons (i.e., Scaffold Count, N50, GC content) and table S4 represents structural variations between RefSeq assemblies and ATCC Standard Reference Genomes.

2. Database_survey contains scripts related to the creation of table S2 (and all other tables). These download and parse metadata from RefSeq, ENSEMBL, and JGI. Only data derived from RefSeq was used in the publication.

3. RefSeq_to_ATCC_small_variation contains scripts related to the creation of table S5 that will compare ATCC Standard Reference Genome fastq files to their corresponding RefSeq assemblies and then parse the output.

Please see individual Readme files within each folder for more details.
